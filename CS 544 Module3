Part 1) 
Use the myPrimes function from Lab4. Using this function, generate all prime numbers that are less than 10000. Create a data frame with three columns, the prime number, the last digit of the prime number, and the first digit of the prime number. Do not use string functions. Show the barplot of the frequencies for the last digit. Show the barplot of the frequencies for the first digit. The resulting data frame is as shown below:
Part 2) 
Use the coins (UsingR) dataset. Do not use explicit loops for any calculations. Do not hard code the denominations in the solution. The solution should work for any denominations.
a) How many coins are there of each denomination? What denomination has the highest number of coins?
b) What is the total value of the coins for each denomination? What denomination has the highest total value?
c) What is the total value of all the coins?
d) Which year(s) have the highest number of coins? Show the barplot for the number of coins by year.
Part 3) 
Use the south (UsingR) dataset.
a) Show the stem plot of the data. What do you interpret from this plot?
b) Show the five number summary of the data. Calculate the lower and upper ends of the outlier ranges. What are the outliers in the data?
c) Show the horizontal boxplot of the data along with the appropriate labels on the plot.
Part 4) 
Suppose that a football (NFL), basketball (NBA), and hockey (NHL) games are being shown at the same time. Consider the two-way summarized data shown below showing the preferences of men and women what sport they wish to watch.
a) Using cbind, create the matrix for the above data.
b) Set the row names for the data.
c) Set the column names for the data.
d) Now, add the dimension variables Gender and Sport to the data. e) Show the marginal distributions for the Gender and the Sport.
f) Show the result of adding margins to the data.
g) Show the proportional data separately for Gender and Sport. Interpret the results.
h) Using appropriate colors, show the mosaic plot for the data. Also show the barplot for Gender and Sport separately with the bars side by side. Add legend to the plots.
Part 5) 
Use the midsize (UsingR) dataset.
a) Show the pair wise plots for all the variables. b) Provide at least 4 interpretations of the results.
Part 6) 
Use the MLBattend (UsingR) dataset.
a) Extract the wins for the teams BAL, BOS, DET, LA, PHI into the respective vectors. b) Create a data frame of five columns using these vectors. Use the team names for the columns
c) Show the boxplot of the data frame.
d) Provide at least 5 interpretations of the results.
Part 7) 
Initialize the House and Senate data as shown below:
house <- read.csv('http://kalathur.com/house.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE) senate <- read.csv('http://kalathur.com/senate.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
Provide the simplest R code for the following:
a) Show how many senators and house members are there by party lines?
b) Show the top 10 states in decreasing order by the number of house members in that state?
c) Use a box plot on the number of house members per state and determine which states are outliers?
d) What is the average number of years served by party line in the house and senate respectively?
